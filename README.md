# machine-learning-algorithms
This repository contains projects created for educational purposes about basic machine learning algorithms.

## Linear Regression(Boston Housing Dataset):
An .ipynb file where we deployed a Linear Regression model from ScikitLearn in order to fit our data. The main purpose of this notebook is to test different split sizes of the data and observe which one seems to be a better fit for our condition.

## Logistic Regression SVM Naive Bayes:
An .ipynb file in which we used three models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) for a classification task. The purpose of this exercise is to find a matching model under the best conditions (based on the accuracy of each model) that can better fit our data.
