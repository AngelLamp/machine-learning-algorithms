## Logistic Regression SVM Naive Bayes:
An .ipynb file in which we used three models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) for a classification task. The purpose of this exercise is to find a matching model under the best conditions (based on the accuracy of each model) that can better fit our data.
